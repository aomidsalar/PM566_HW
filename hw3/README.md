# Part 1: APIs

### Look for papers that show up under the term *sars-cov-2 trial vaccine*


```r
# Downloading the website
website <- read_html(x = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2+trial+vaccine")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
numberpapers  <- stringr::str_extract(counts, "[:digit:]+.*[:digit:]")
```

There are 2,315 papers with the search term *sars-cov-2 trial vaccine*
### Download each paper's abstracts


```r

Since the beginning of the pandemic, available data suggested the asymptomatic transmission and patients were treated with specific drugs with efficacy and safety data not always satisfactory. <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this review is to describe the vaccines developed by three companies, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, in terms of both technological and pharmaceutical formulation, safety, efficacy and immunogenicity. <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A critical analysis of phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trial results available was conducted, comparing the three vaccine candidates, underlining their similarities and differences. <AbstractText Label="RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">All candidates showed consistent efficacy and tolerability; although some differences can be noted, such as their technological formulation, temperature storage, which will be related to logistics and costs. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate long-term effects and to assess the vaccine safety and efficacy in the general population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This off-target effect could reduce the impact of emerging pathogens. As a readily available, inexpensive intervention that has a well-established safety profile, BCG is a good candidate for protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and other vulnerable groups against COVID-19. <AbstractText Label="METHODS AND ANALYSIS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This international multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial aims to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 at 6 months (co-primary outcomes) compared with no BCG vaccination. We plan to randomise 10 078 HCWs from Australia, The Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Brazil in a 1:1 ratio to BCG vaccination or no BCG (control group). The participants will be followed for 1 year with questionnaires and collection of blood samples. For any episode of illness, clinical details will be collected daily, and the participant will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the rate, incidence, and severity of any febrile or respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2), as well as work absenteeism. The safety of BCG vaccination in HCWs will also be evaluated. Immunological analyses will assess changes in the immune system following vaccination, and identify factors associated with susceptibility to or protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. <AbstractText Label="ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Ethical and governance approval will be obtained from participating sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals.

In the United States alone, three vaccinations have been authorized for emergency use (EUA) or approved to prevent COVID-19. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine by Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, New Jersey) is the only adenovirus-based vaccine and deemed relatively effective and safe by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following its clinical trial. Since its introduction, the US FDA has placed a warning on the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) after more than 100 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) were reported. Herein, we outline the hospital course of a generally healthy 49-year-old female who experienced an axonal form of GBS nine days after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

Vaccination may be important for infection prevention, but there are limited data on vaccine immunogenicity in this population. We conducted a prospective observational study of the humoral immunogenicity of commercially available 2019-2020 inactivated influenza vaccines in adults immediately prior to or while in durable remission after CD19-, CD20-, or B cell maturation antigen-targeted CAR-T-cell therapy, as well as controls. We tested for antibodies to all four vaccine strains using neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays. Antibody responses were defined as at least fourfold titer increases from baseline. Seroprotection was defined as a HAI titer ≥40. Enrolled CAR-T-cell recipients were vaccinated 14-29 days prior to (n=5) or 13-57 months following therapy (n=13), and the majority had hypogammaglobulinemia and cellular immunodeficiencies prevaccination. Eight non-immunocompromised adults served as controls. Antibody responses to ≥1 vaccine strain occurred in 2 (40%) individuals before CAR-T-cell therapy and in 4 (31%) individuals vaccinated after CAR-T-cell therapy. An additional 1 (20%) and 6 (46%) individuals had at least twofold increases, respectively. One individual vaccinated prior to CAR-T-cell therapy maintained a response for &gt;3 months following therapy. Across all tested vaccine strains, seroprotection was less frequent in CAR-T-cell recipients than in controls. There was evidence of immunogenicity even among individuals with low immunoglobulin, CD19+ B cell, and CD4+ T-cell counts. These data support consideration for vaccination before and after CAR-T-cell therapy for influenza and other relevant pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of hypogammaglobulinemia or B cell aplasia. However, relatively impaired humoral vaccine immunogenicity indicates the need for additional infection-prevention strategies. Larger studies are needed to refine our understanding of potential correlates of vaccine immunogenicity, and durability of immune responses, in CAR-T-cell therapy recipients. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus complicates incorporation of LD-RT into existing radiation oncology clinics. <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS/METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The first phase I/II trial of LD-RT for COVID-19-related pneumonia implemented novel operational protocols to address risk of infection and respiratory events. Patients were transported from hospital rooms to linear accelerators and treated with 0.5 Gy or 1.5 Gy using pre-planned, two-dimensional treatments prepared using diagnostic x-rays and caliper measurements. Workflows were revised over time to balance infection risks with implementation burden. <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Between April 24 and December 7, 2020, fifty-two patients were enrolled and forty were treated. The end-to-end process comprised 16 distinct teams and &gt; 120 cooperating staff members (&gt; 50 core radiation oncology staff). The trial was operationalized at two hospitals at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, prior to vaccine availability. Teams included trial leadership/screening (n &gt; 4), inpatient floor staff (n &gt; 10), clinical trials staff and coordinators (n = 8), transport (n = 2), radiation therapists (n &gt; 20), respiratory therapists (n = 5), radiation nursing (n &gt; 7), ICU nursing (n = 4), rapid response teams (n = 4), medical physics (n &gt; 4), dosimetry (n &gt; 3), infection prevention (n &gt; 3), environmental services (n &gt; 6), security (n = 7), lab personnel (n = 1), and physicians from radiation oncology (n = 7), infectious diseases (n = 2), pulmonary/critical care medicine (n = 2), anesthesia (n = 2), and internal medicine (n &gt; 20) [total &gt; 120]. All non-intubated patients were transported by a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of a physician, nurse, transporter, infection prevention specialist, and (when needed) a respiratory therapist. Treatments occurred after normal clinic hours, were initiated by team huddles, check lists, and included personal protective equipment supervision at multiple time points. Transport routes were 880 to 1760 feet (0.33 miles) one-way, with 1 to 3 elevator banks and required 20-35 minutes for round-trip transport and treatment. Oxygen supplementation in non-intubated patients ranged from 2 to 15 L/min. One intubated patient was transported with a portable ventilator and accompanying ICU staff. There were no code-level events during transport. No patient-facing staff contracted COVID-19 from trial activities. Workflow burden was successfully reduced and protocols relaxed over time with increased staff experience. <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19-related pneumonia was successfully incorporated into existing workflows at a major academic university. Forty patients were treated with no code-level events, and no staff contracted the virus during eight months of trial accrual. Instructional materials and implementation check lists are provided.

We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic and any SARS͏CoV2 infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">VE against asymptomatic infection measured by PCR or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias towards underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4 to 77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8 to 80.7) respectively. <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Multiple biases are likely to influence COVID-19 VE estimates, potentially explaining the observed difference between ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. These biases should be considered when interpreting both efficacy and effectiveness study results. © The Author(s) 2021.

However, recruitment of participants for clinical trials can be challenging, and recruitment failure is among the most common reasons for discontinuation in clinical trials. From 20 May 2020, public announcements about a planned phase I trial of the vaccine candidate MVA-SARS-2-S against SARS-CoV-2 began, and interested individuals started contacting the study team via designated e-mail. All emails received from these individuals between 20 May 2020-30 September 2020 were assessed. Of the 2541 interested volunteers, 62% contacted the study team within three days after the first media announcement. The average age was 61 years (range 16-100), 48% of volunteers were female and 52% male. A total of 274, 186, and 53 individuals, respectively, reported medical pre-conditions, were health-care workers, or had frequent inter-person contacts. In conclusion, we report a high number of volunteers, with a considerable percentage stating factors for an elevated risk to acquire COVID-19 or develop severe disease. Factors such as media coverage and the perception of a disease as an acute threat may influence the individual's choice to volunteer for a vaccine trial. Our data provide first important insights to better understand reasons to participate in such trials to facilitate trial implementation and recruitment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
